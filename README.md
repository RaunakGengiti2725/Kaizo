# 🌱 Vegan Vision AI

**The world's first comprehensive, AI-powered product analysis platform for conscious consumers.**

## 🎯 What We Solve

Growing up, many of our closest friends were vegetarian and vegan. We watched them struggle daily with the same frustrating problem - standing in grocery stores, squinting at tiny ingredient labels, trying to figure out if a product was safe for them to eat.

Current solutions are fragmented and incomplete. You have barcode scanners that only tell you basic product info, separate apps for ingredient checking, and no real way to understand the environmental impact of what you're buying. Users juggle multiple tools and still don't get the full picture.

**Vegan Vision AI solves this by providing everything you need to know about a product in one scan.**
